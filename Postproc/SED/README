Spectral Energy Density (SED) is the phonon energy spectral density, which is used to analyze the phonon dispersion of materials after MD simulations.

Usage: python3 cal_SED.py dev=0/1/2/3 num=10000/20000/30000/..

dev: the order of derivation of atom position, 1st order means velocity, 2nd order means acceleration....
num: the number of steps you will used to calculate the SED, which means the last num MD steps will be adopted. 

Note: this script is used for MS trajectory, thus, you should convert your MS trajectory file (xtd) to reading file (xyz in txt). You can use the script of "xtd2xyz.pl" which will be found in the internet, and the author is Andrea Minoia.
